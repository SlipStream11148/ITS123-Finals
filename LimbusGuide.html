		his Type Resistances to Fatal, loses the turn it is going to attack and the next turn and more subsequent damage taken is increased, the higher the Thresholds achieved; higher the damage taken.

	<br>Additional E.G.Os obtained throught Extract (Gacha) or Dispense can corrode;
	<br>E.G.Os able to corrode can also be <b>Overclock</b> to instantly use the corrode version; Overclock can be used holding down the E.G.O. It costs the 1.5x of the Sanity and Sin resources.</p>
	<p><strong>Forced E.G.O usage through Corrosion or Overclock will consume resources and with not enough resources the cost is substracted beyond 0, meaning it will go negative.</strong></p>

	Sanity Points (SP) works similarly as health, can be seen under the sprite, around the portrait or selecting said character, shown by a circle at the right side of the character, determines the morale during the fight, always 	starts at 0 (exceptions apply) and can go to -45 or +45, The higher the sanity the probability is higher to hits heads while the lower the sanity the probability to hits tails is higher and higher the chance the said character 	to corrode their EGO (if there is one able to). Chance of flipping heads by sanity 0 sanity (50%), +45 (95%), -45 (5%)
	<b>A corrosion of the E.G.O the Sin resources are spent doing so, being possible to run in negative values, and then setting the SP back to 0.</b></p>

        <br><br><h3><strong>Passive and Support Passive</strong></h3>
        <p>Every Sinner/Identity have a Passive and a Support Passive.</p>
	<p>A Passive is applied to a Sinner currently deployed most of the time affecting themselves unless conditions are different.
	<br>A Support Passive is applied to a Sinner not deployed or in the reserve in case of Chain Battles.
	<br>The Support Passive affects only one Sinner deployed that meets the requirements of the Support Passive, if more Sinners meet the requirements, it will follow the deployment order. (see further in the guide).</p>

            <li>Evade - Avoids taking damage;</li>

	<p><u>Clashable Defensive Skill</u></p>
        <p>An unique type of defense skill that is able to clash against the opponent Offensive Skill, even if is not targeted for a clash, <u>one-sided attacks will trigger the clashable defense skills.</u></p>
        <p><strong>Same as Offensive Skills, winning and losing clashes counts for the Sanity Conditions.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Some Defensive Skills might have special effects tied to them such as Clashable Guard:</strong></p>
	<ul>
            <li>On Clash Win: Raise the target's Stagger Threshold by this unit's final Clash Power.</li>
            <li>On Clash Lose when hit, reduce the attacker's final Skill Power by this unit's Final Power.</li>
            <li>On Clash Lose: does not gain Final Power from the following sources: Resonance and the Level disparity against the Attack Skill.</li>

	<ul>

	<br><br><p>Skills have a Base Power and a Plus (+) or Minus (-) that increases or decreases after every Coin Flip (Heads or Tails),</p>
	<p>Example:

	<br><u>Assuming all coins were heads, the final damage is going to be 18.</u>
	During an attack depending on the Sinner/Identity each coin have a condition applied besides damage.</p>
	<p>Example:
	<br><b>Molar Boatworks Fixer Ishmael</b> Skill 3 <u>Risky Judgement</u> has 3 coins and each coin (regardless of heads or tails) is going to apply the effects each time the coin is flipped.
	<br><u>Assuming all coins still intact:</u>
	<br>(I) First coin will apply 5 <u>Sinking Count;</u>
	<br>(II) Second coin will apply 3 <u>Sinking Potency</u> and if the conditions are met (5 <u>Tremor Count</u> on self) inflict one <u>Fragile</u> next turn;
	<br>(III) Third coin will apply 3 <u>Sinking Potency</u> and if the conditions are met (5 <u>Tremor Count</u> on self) inflict 2 <u>Fragile</u> next turn.
	<br><b>Molar Ishmael</b> requires 10 <u>Tremor Count</u> on self to take full benefit of the Skill, the end result being 6 <u>Sinking Potency</u>, 5 <u>Sinking Count</u>, 3 <u>Fragile</u>.</p>

	<!--i - Resonance (Reson) and Absolute Resonance (A-Reson)-->

	<br><h3><strong>Resonance (Reson) and Absolute Resonance (A-Reson)</strong></h3>
	<p>Resonance can happen when the Player <u>chains</u> 2 or 3 more skills of the same Sin, chaining separate skills counts only as <u>Resonance</u> while in a sequence of three or more counts as <u>Absolute Resonance</u>
	<br><strong>Absolute Resonating skills increase the Base Offense of said skills to 3+ or more</strong>. However it is not ideal to always chase it.</p>
	<p>Other benefits Resonance and Absolute Resonance can give:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Skills that mentions Resonance and Absolute Resonance</li>
	<li>Activate Identities Res passive/support passive</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Breaking a Resonance chain and making another at the same time only considers an Absolute Resonance the chain that has 3 Sins of the same color.</strong></p>

	<p>Offense Level affects the Base Power of Offensive Skills, contributing to <u>Clash</u> and <u>Damage dealt</u>.</p>
	<p>For every three (3) Offensive Level difference against the offensive clashing opponent, the attacker with the higher Offensive Level gets one (1) Clashing Power.</p>
