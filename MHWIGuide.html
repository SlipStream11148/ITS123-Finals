        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Here you play as an esteemed hunter assigned to aid the Research Commission in the investigation of the New World, a new fleet arrives every 10 years when the “Elder’s Crossing” happens, with the current generation being the 5th.</p>
        <img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/T45XQs7nPHkF1l1dCuKeux14bZNNMKYeUU45pFwF3HM.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3654b83bd5bb3a17c4d45f5b36b985208570b4a0" class="center">
		<p>After you’re done with creating your hunter and their Palico, just follow along with the tutorials. The intention of this game was to welcome many newcomers to the Monster Hunter series, but despite the handhold-y nature, there are many things the game will keep vague or not tell you about. This guide will go over things I think the game glosses over.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="controls" class="container container-content py-5">
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>Do keep in mind the series is very much “console first” and that the default keyboard and mouse controls are not the best. The game also expects you to have two side buttons on your mouse. I highly suggest looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/2lU2e_boztk?si=HBJ9uh3CtyKS47gp">this guide</a> if you want to remap your buttons.</p>

    <section id="multiplayer" class="container container-content py-5">
        <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
        <p>You may have up to 4 players in a single hunt, having more than 2 players will make your Palico stay behind in the camp. Before you depart on a quest, you can choose how many maximum players may join and even set up a password if you wish to only allow specific players to join, otherwise, anybody in the lobby can join your quest via quest board or talking to the handler.</p>
        <p>Alternatively you can fire an SOS flare, opening up the quest to anybody in the world regardless of lobby.</p>

		<p>This is useful if you are struggling on a quest, remember, there is no shame in asking for help!</p>
        <p><b>Multiplayer in Assigned quests?</b></p>
        <p>Multiplayer in story quests can be frustratingly complex. Everyone needs to have watched the cutscene associated with the quest, and there is no way to skip cutscenes unless you decide to mod your game. Below is the best method the community has come up with for taking on the story in multiplayer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start the mission</li>
            <li>Finish the cutscene</li>
            <li>Once you see “You can now fire an SOS flare” the quest is open for multiplayer</li>
            <li>(Optional) return from quest or abandon the quest, best option if you all want to take it on at the same time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Gearing Up</h2>
        <p>Monster Hunter is all about hunting creatures to make better gear. This section won’t exactly dive into meta builds, but rather aims to help the player into making better gear choices.</p>
       
	   <section id="armor" class="container container-content py-5">
	   <h3>Armor</h3>
        <p>Armor provides defense and elemental resistances to help you survive attacks better, it is simply damage reduction. However it is important to note that once you reach 20 elemental resistance for a specific element, you will not receive its blight anymore.</li>
        <li>Fire - fireblight, a damage-over-time (DoT) effect that drains your health and leaves no recoverable hp (the red gauge in your health upon taking damage). Can be put out by rolling thrice or rolling once in water.</li>
        <li>Water - waterblight, you regain stamina at 1/3rd the normal rate, the effect lasts for one minute. Can be cured with a nullberry or cleanser booster.</li>
        <li>Thunder - thunderblight, attacks have a higher chance of stunning you, the effect lasts for one minute or until the hunter is stunned. Can be cured with a nullberry, cleanser booster, or by rolling up to seven times.</li>
        <li>Ice - iceblight, you consume more stamina than usual, 5x normal speed for continuous Stamina depletion, and 2x for fixed Stamina depletion. This effect lasts for one minute. Can be cured with a nullberry or cleanser booster, also by standing in hot springs.</li>
        <li>Dragon - dragonblight, any element or status effect on your weapon is disabled for the entire duration of the blight, the effect lasts for one minute. Can be cured with a nullberry or cleanser booster.</li>
        <p></p>
		<p>Armor is also crucial for adding skills that will both boost your damage and give you a higher chance of survivability. For the entirety of low rank, you can ignore this and opt for armor with high defense as there aren’t many great skills yet.</p>
		<p>Once you unlock high rank, most armor sets will be split into two versions. Alpha or α sets usually offer more of the armor sets’ innate skills while sacrificing Decoration slots. Beta or 	β sets have less of the armor sets’ innate skills but offer either more or higher levels of slots. The cost to make them is always the same, you aren’t required to make a full set and you can mix and match alpha and beta pieces much like you can mix sets from other monsters.</p>

		<section id="weapons" class="container container-content py-5">
        <h3>Weapons</h4>
		<img src="https://game.capcom.com/manual/MHW/pre/img/index/bnr_cont02_03.jpg" class="center">
        <p>The game has a total of 14 weapons, 11 melee or Blademaster weapons and 3 ranged or Gunner weapons. There is no “best” weapon here, it is entirely up to personal preference and as such, I won’t be trying to suggest which weapon you should pick up and play. Instead I will focus on the attributes universal to all weapons.</p>
		<li>Every weapon has an Attack stat, this is what we call the Raw, almost all your damage relies on this stat. </li> 
		<li>Every weapon has Affinity, this is your critical strike chance, it adds +25% damage to your hit if it crits. This is indicated by an orange star underneath the damage number.</li>
		<li>Some weapons have negative affinity, this instead makes the hit do -25% damage, this is indicated by a hit having a blue star underneath the damage number.</li>
        <li>Once you get to high rank, some weapons may have Slots, this is where you can insert Decorations to fit more skills into your build.</li>
		<img src="https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Monster-Hunter-World/affinity-equipment-screen-mhw.jpg">
		<p></p>
		<p>These are stats that are important regardless of weapon, and there is no decisive proof as to which is better to prioritize, I suggest keeping a balance of both.</p>
		
		<h3>Blademaster Specifics</h3>
        <p>All melee weapons have sharpness, the more you hit with your weapon, the more it will degrade in a fight, using a whetstone or whetfish fin will restore it back to its original sharpness. This is important because it dictates how effective your weapon will be, your weapon may start bouncing off the monster’s body when reaching yellow or below. On top of that, you start to lose damage at orange to red sharpness, losing 0.75x and 0.50x respectively. </p>
        <p>A hit consumes 1 sharpness, a bounce consumes 2, guarding will also make you lose some sharpness however that depends on the knockback of the hit. There will also be some weapons that have moves that will consume more sharpness than usual.</p>
		<img src="https://preview.redd.it/kpzx7t4j7s331.jpg?auto=webp&s=080951899299c19c1cdb320af1c27d3dad0acea0">
        <p></p>
		<h4>Gunner Specifics</h4>
        <p>Not every Bow and Bowgun have access to all coatings and bullets, you can check in the forge/upgrade menus which coatings or bullets the weapon you want to craft has access to. While Bows can enable the usage of certain coatings thanks to decos, the same cannot be said for Bowguns.</p>
		<p>Both Heavy and Light Bowguns instead have specific gimmicks called Deviation, this dictates how much your crosshair will move after you take a shot. If you’ve played shooter games before, this is better known as recoil. The Bowguns can be modified, how many attachments will depend on the rarity of your weapon, Heavy Bowguns max out at 5 attachments while Light Bowguns max out at 4. These attachments can range from lowering reload time, lowering recoil, increasing range before bullet fall-off, etc.</p>
	
		<h3>Elements and Statuses</h3
		<p>Sometimes, a weapon will have an element or status effect paired with it. Think of elements as a damage multiplier, if you match it to a monster’s elemental weakness you will do more damage to it. However not every weapon excels at doing elemental damage, the rule of thumb is that weapon types that can do many hits in a short span of time (i.e. Bow, Dual Blades, Charge Blade) will benefit the most from elemental builds rather than raw damage.</p>
		<p>Status effects don’t apply any damage multipliers and are best used on raw builds. Poison and blast do added damage while paralysis and sleep immobilize the monster, all of which must be built up by constantly attacking the monster with the weapon. Blademaster weapons have a ⅓ chance to proc status buildup on hit, while Gunners bullets and arrow coatings have a 100% chance to apply buildup.</p>
		<p>If your weapon has the element or status effect greyed out and the number is enclosed in parentheses, you need to have the skill Free Elem/Ammo Up to use it. Maxing out this skill will grant you 100% of the element/status, while having only one or two levels will grant you 33% and 66% respectively.</p>

		<h3>Skills</h3>
		<p>This is what you’ll be spending most of your time theorycrafting with. I want to start by saying don’t worry about the meta. Most, if not all meta builds are made to maximize damage at the sacrifice of comfort/defensive skills. But if you aren’t sure which skills you should prioritize for your weapon, feel free to take ideas from the meta. What I am going to give you is just a general list of skills that should work for any weapon, a general rule of thumb if you will.</p>
		<p>The best defensive skills are:</p>
		<li>Health boost - your base hp is only 100, with this skill at max level you gain +50, eating before hunting will grant you another +50 bringing your total hp to 200.</li>
		<li>Divine blessing - has a 25% chance to reduce the damage you take from an attack, cutting the damage by 50% at max level.</li>
		<li>Stun-free - makes you get out of the stunned animation quicker, while preventing it entirely at max level. Being stunned in a fight at low health is the most common reason behind fainting, this skill prevents that. This skill also negates Tzitzi-ya-ku’s flash.</li>
		<p>There are many more comfort skills but which to take are personal preference.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>For offensive skills, aim for critical eye, weakness exploit, and critical boost. Attack boost is only good at lvl4 and 7. If you have the Iceborne expansion, you have access to the clutch claw, making agitator a very good option.</p>
		<li>Critical eye - Increases affinity by +5% with each level, you gain +40% at max level.</li>
		<li>Weakness exploit - Attacks on a monster’s weak spot will have increased affinity, with an extra increase on tenderized parts. It is a 30% increase on weak spots with an extra 20% at max level.</li>
		<li>Critical boost - Increases the damage dealt by critical hits, it is 40% at max level.</li>
		<li>Agitator - Increases your raw and affinity when the monster is enraged. It is +20 raw and +10% affinity at max level. A solid choice if you have the Iceborne expansion as it gives you access to the clutch claw, which can force a monster to enrage quicker.</li>
		<li>Attack boost - Increases raw by +3 with each level, also gains +5% affinity on levels 4-7. You gain +21 raw and +5% affinity at max level. Only worth to use this skill if you can get it at either level 4 or 7.</li>
		<p></p>
		<p>There are some skills that are considered newbie traps, meaning that it may look/sound good but is actually really bad in the long run. Defense boost is the most obvious due to diminishing returns, you can fit more offensive skills along with maxed out divine blessing and it will perform better than maxed defense boost. What other skills are considered newbie traps are often weapon dependent.</p>
